## Catholic Social Teaching and Water Justice:

Catholic Social Teaching is an important part of the University of St. Thomas’s values and mission. One of the main principles of Catholic Social Teaching is Life and Dignity of the Human Person, which directly protects the preservation of water and water justice. The core of this principle of Catholic Social Teaching calls for everyone to care for each other and make sure that each person is able to live in a way that honors their human dignity; this ultimately includes having access to basic needs, especially water. The lack of access to clean water both locally and globally inevitably creates living conditions that do not honor the dignity of the human person. In order to be aligned with the University of St. Thomas’s values and those of Catholic Social Teaching, it is both important and necessary that we, as a community, work to protect and preserve water and the communities that are most affected by its scarcity.
