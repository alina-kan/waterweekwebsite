### Sustainability requires responsibly using and managing natural resources to meet our needs today without harming the possibilities of future generations meeting their own tomorrow. Sustainability is central to the University of St. Thomasâ€™ mission of educating morally responsible leaders who think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good. Our understanding of, and commitment to, sustainability is grounded in our identity as a Catholic university. This plan embraces the principles of caring for creation, environmental stewardship and advancing the common good. These beliefs encompass a concern for social equity, economic prosperity and the healthy functioning of ecological systems both now and in the future. By implementing this plan, we aim to model sustainability in our own practices and to educate students who will improve lives today and build a better world for future generations.

### Vision
- By catalyzing university-wide engagement, we will create a culture that prepares students to be sustainability leaders during their university years and beyond.

### Goals
- Achieve a STARS gold rating by 2025
    - Institutions use STARS to assess sustainability performance in four main categories: academics, engagement, operations, and planning and administration
    - In 2018, St. Thomas proudly earned a STARS silver rating, with an initial score of 49.23. The university has set a goal to improve its score to a minimum of 65 to earn a STARS gold rating by 2025
- Achieve carbon neutrality by 2035
    - Implementing energy conservation measures in existing buildings 
    - Pursuing LEED certification for new buildings 
    - Reducing emissions from university-owned vehicles 
    - Reducing emissions from student and employee commutes 
    - Offsetting emissions from study abroad air travel
- Collectively, the goals and actions in this plan will set the university on a course to reduce annual carbon emissions by 50% below 2007 emissions by 2024.
